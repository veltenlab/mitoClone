\usage{
mutationCallsFromMatrix(
  M,
  N,
  cluster = NULL,
  metadata = data.frame(row.names = rownames(M)),
  binarize = 0.05
)
}
\arguments{
\item{M}{A matrix of read counts mapping to the \emph{mutant} allele. Columns are genomic sites and rows and single cells.}

\item{N}{A matrix of read counts mapping to the \emph{mutant} allele. Columns are genomic sites and rows and single cells.}

\item{cluster}{If \code{NULL}, only mutations with coverage in 20% of the cells or more will be used for the clustering, and all other mutations will be used for cluster annotation only. Alternatively, a boolean vector of length \code{ncol(M)} that specifies the desired behavior for each genomic site.}

\item{binarize}{Allele frequency threshold to define a site as mutant (required for some clustering methods)}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{\link{mutationCalls}}.
}
\description{
To be used when allele-specific count matrices are available.
