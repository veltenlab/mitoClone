Title: Clonal tracking in single-cell RNA-seq data using mitochondrial mutations
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Lars Velten, Ben Story
Maintainer: Lars Velten <lars.velten@crg.eu>
Description: This package identifies somatic variants in mitochondrial genomes from aligned BAM files; 
    filters these variants to remove RNA editing events; 
    estimates their evolutionary relationship (i.e. their phylogenetic tree);
    and finally groups single cells into clones using a probabilistic approach.
